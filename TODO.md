Everything and then some!

Short Term 
----------
1. Finish parsing framework to read in the GoGoD Data (sgfParser).
2. Create ko checker based on hashing function of Byte array representing board states.
3. Write a converter that turns a sequence of positions into "features" for ML.
4. Implement an SVN to predict winner given a board position.

Medium Term
-----------
1. Connect scala to cuDNN to implement a NN predictor.
2. Distribute ML using Spark.

Long Term
---------
Maybe by then my AI robot can help me write some of this code.

1. Use Akka to distribute some of this work.
2. Run this on AWS.
