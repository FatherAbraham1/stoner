stoner (as in Go stone, you hippy)
==================================
A research project to develop an [automated](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence) [Go](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)) player using machine learning techniques rather than typical tree descent searches.  The primary language will be [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org).

Problem Formulation
-------------------
The problem I wish to solve is as follows:

* Given a Go board position **P**, without accompanying game history except for illegal moves due to ko, find the move **M** that maximizes the probability of a resulting game win.
